A very simple bare minimum 'Blinky' (LED blinker) running on a NXP LPC824 (LPC824M201JDH20 TSSOP20 package) mounted on a breakout board with nothing connected but a single LED and Serial Wire Debug port.

** THIS CURRENTLY IS NOT WORKING FOR ME ** Posted for GitHub so as I can post query to LPCWare.com forums. Once working I'll update to a working example.

Setup:

A LPC824M201JDH20 TSSOP20 package is mounted on a breakout board and then mounted on a breadboard. The SWD pins (RESET, SWCLK, SWDIO, GND, 3.3V) are connected to LPCLink1.1 board (a LPCXpresso LPC812 dev board with the target part of the board disconnected).  

The ISP pins are also connected.
